# Drink Water

### Create a webpage that shows user how much water he needs to drink to complete the daily target. The webpage should include the following elements:

- A heading (h1) with the content "Drink Water". A heading h3 with content : "Goal : 2 Litres"
- A div with class `cup` to represent the larger cup. This div contains two divs with class and ids both as `remained` and `percentage`.
- A paragraph with class `text` containing text : "Select how many glasses of water that you have drank"
- A outer div with class cups that contains 8 divs with common class `cup` ans `cup-small`. The id for each cup would be `cup-1`, `cup-2`.... and so on.
- When a user click on any of the small cup all the cups before that including that cup are filled and a class named `full` is added to all the cups before it.
- If the user click again on the same small cup `full` is removed from that particular cup.
- Also after clicking on the any of the small cup the text inside the large cup showing the remained quantity and % filled also changes.

The webpage should look this :
